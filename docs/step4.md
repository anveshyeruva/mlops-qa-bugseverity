# ðŸ“– Step 4: Experiment Tracking (MLflow)

## Objectives
- Track metrics (accuracy, f1), params, and artifacts for each training run.
- Enable easy comparison across runs.

## Plan
1) Add optional MLflow logging to train.py (guarded by --mlflow flag).
2) Log metrics, params, confusion matrix, and model.
3) Capture screenshots and summarize results.

## Commands (to be updated as we implement)
